# Selenium WebDriver (Java) for NeoLoad

## Overview

The Selenium WebDriver (java) allows you to use a Selenium script to create or update NeoLoad User Paths and/or measure the end user experience on one or a few browsers or mobile devices and to send these measurements to NeoLoad using the Data Exchange API.

Tested wrapped drivers include browser drivers (ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriverâ€¦) and the Perfecto driver.
